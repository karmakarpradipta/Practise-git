##Hello git

Hi, My name is Pradipta Karmakar
and today i hear to practise some git command.
Here i will practise some git command to know how the git works.
Git and GitHub are not the similer thing git is a distributed version control system to track the changes of our code and it do these things locally but Github is a cloud based version control system.
